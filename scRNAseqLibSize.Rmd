In shallow single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), the problem of zeros is pervasive.  There are two main sources of zeros: genes that are not expressed and genes that are expressed but not sequenced.  These are called systematic and stochastic zeros, respectively ([Lun et al 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0947-7#Fig1)).  Stochastic zeros can arise from two sources: genes that were unsequenced due to the shallow sequencing depth and genes that dropped out due to technical effects.  Distinguishing between the two is difficult.

Consider the following model proposed by [Hicks et al 2015](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/12/27/025528.full.pdf).
